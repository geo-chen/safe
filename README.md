# Automated Forensics Investigator (AFI)

Security incidents are triggered based on matches on alerts, and these alerts are based on a small selected set of aggregated logs. Whenever a server is suspected to be compromised, we go back to the source for the rest of the logs to investigate on traffic and endpoint.

The AFI enables teams to run automated forensics investigations on a selected set of machines, either specified or sampled, on both Windows and Linux, to get a baseline threat score on the likelyhood of a server compromise. A number of logs, including web server, syslog, system, network logs are surveyed for this analysis.

## Forensics Scripts

Current forensics scripts come in two flavours - Linux and Windows.
